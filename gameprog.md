#### Strengths and weaknesses with unity
##### Strengths:
- Large asset store
   - Unity has an expansive asset store offering both paid and free content, providing abundant opportunities for game design, and was our main reason for choosing Unity as our game engine.
- Strong community and documentation
    - In addition to a large asset store, Unity has a strong community and documentation which makes it easy to find help online if you are stuck. This proved invaluable for team members unfamiliar with Unity, as tutorials were readily available to guide us through the necessary features for game development.
- Integration with popular tools
    - Unity seamlessly integrates with popular tools such as GitHub and Visual Studio, enhancing code storage and writing processes. This integration significantly contributed to the smooth development of our project.
- Learning curve
    - While Unity presents a steep learning curve, particularly for beginners, its strong community and tutorial resources make it beginner-friendly over time. The initial challenge diminishes as familiarity with Unity grows, resulting in a user-friendly and efficient development environment.

##### Weaknesses:
- Graphics and rendering
   - Unity falls short in terms of graphics and rendering compared to some other game engines, such as Unreal. However, for our project, Unity's graphical capabilities met our requirements, making this weakness inconsequential for our specific needs.
- Not suitable for large projects
   - Unity has limitations when it comes to larger projects, particularly those involving large landscapes and numerous on-screen objects. Since our project was not of a substantial scale, these limitations did not impact our choice of game engine.
- Cost
    - As students, we benefited from the free student version of Unity. However, for professional developers considering the pro version, costs may be a factor, especially for small companies or individual developers. Fortunately, this was not a concern for our school project.
- Popularity decline
   - Unity faced a decline in popularity, notably after it was announced that games made with Unity would be charged a fee for downloads after certain thresholds were passed. Although this decision was reversed due to significant backlash, it led to a loss of trust among some developers. This development occurred after our selection of Unity, and given the progress we had already made for our school project, we opted to stick with our chosen engine despite the controversy.

#### How you controlled process and communication systems during development
Discord and physical meeting once a week, if time twice a week.
We had meetings once a week to discuss what we were working on, what was completed and what needed to be done. We used the gamedesign document a lot in the beginning to figure out what we wanted to do, but as soon as we had the initial plans ready we did not update it as much as we probably should have. We communicated through discord and in our physical meetings.

Tools- github and jira.
Since we met once a week and most tasks took a lot of time we did not utilize issue tracking for all tasks. Some of us did however use it to keep track of their tasks, while others utilized other tools such as Jira. This worked well for us as everyone kept track of their own work and we showcased and discussed this each week. 

Our team had different levels of prior skils so some of us took on more work than others as one task would take the same time as three tasks for those without prior knowledge. Two of our members had more knowledge so they mostly programmed alone, while the two other members had no prior knowledge and therefor utilized pair-programming to lean on eachother and learn together. Those with more skills would also help to mke the process easier for those who had no prior knowledge.

The semester has been hard with a lot of work to do in not only this subject, but three other (four other for one of our teams mates) subjects. We therefore did not get to work as much as we would have liked to on this project. We also feel like the course had a slow start, and lacked organizing and therefore felt like everything was up to ourselves. 

Overall the process has been okay. The biggest challenge was the differences in prior skills and having enough time, but we managed to get through without too many issues.

#### Use of version control systems, ticket tracking, branching, version control
For version controlling we used git. We did not use branching as we worked on different tasks and coded in different scripts. Instead of branchhes we used scenes in unity so that evryone could work on different tasks without disturbing others work. If we noticed any bugs they would be added to the issue tracker in git with the keyword "Bug" infront of the explaination of the bug.
