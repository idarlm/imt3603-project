#### Strengths and weaknesses with unity
##### Strengths:
- Large asset store
   - Unity has an expansive asset store offering both paid and free content, providing abundant opportunities for game design, and was our main reason for choosing Unity as our game engine.
- Strong community and documentation
    - In addition to a large asset store, Unity has a strong community and documentation which makes it easy to find help online if you are stuck. This proved invaluable for team members unfamiliar with Unity, as tutorials were readily available to guide us through the necessary features for game development.
- Integration with popular tools
    - Unity seamlessly integrates with popular tools such as GitHub and Visual Studio, enhancing code storage and writing processes. This integration significantly contributed to the smooth development of our project.
- Learning curve
    - While Unity presents a steep learning curve, particularly for beginners, its strong community and tutorial resources make it beginner-friendly over time. The initial challenge diminishes as familiarity with Unity grows, resulting in a user-friendly and efficient development environment.

##### Weaknesses:
- Graphics and rendering
   - Unity falls short in terms of graphics and rendering compared to some other game engines, such as Unreal. However, for our project, Unity's graphical capabilities met our requirements, making this weakness inconsequential for our specific needs.
- Not suitable for large projects
   - Unity has limitations when it comes to larger projects, particularly those involving large landscapes and numerous on-screen objects. Since our project was not of a substantial scale, these limitations did not impact our choice of game engine.
- Cost
    - As students, we benefited from the free student version of Unity. However, for professional developers considering the pro version, costs may be a factor, especially for small companies or individual developers. Fortunately, this was not a concern for our school project.
- Popularity decline
   - Unity faced a decline in popularity, notably after it was announced that games made with Unity would be charged a fee for downloads after certain thresholds were passed. Although this decision was reversed due to significant backlash, it led to a loss of trust among some developers. This development occurred after our selection of Unity, and given the progress we had already made for our school project, we opted to stick with our chosen engine despite the controversy.

#### Process and Communication
Throughout the project, our team utilized both Discord and weekly physical meetings, occasionally increasing the frequency to twice a week based on availability. Weekly meetings served as a platform to discuss ongoing tasks, completed work, and tasks remaining. In the initial stages, the game design document was extensively used to plan our game; however, its updates tapered off once the initial plans were established.

We leveraged GitHub and Jira as our primary tools for project planning. GitHub served as our repository for code storage, while Jira was used for documentation. Within Jira, we crafted our game design document, an art design document for creative inspiration, and a document dedicated to puzzles and the player movement system. The allocation of tasks and project progress updates were primarily addressed during our regular meetings. While GitHub's issue tracker was utilized by some team members to monitor individual tasks, others opted for Jira or alternative tools. Some team members found the GitHub issue tracker to be less preferable, and had we opted for GitLab, we might have utilized its issue tracking functionality more extensively. Despite tool variations, our commitment to weekly updates ensured a cohesive understanding of project progress among all team members.

We also used GitHub as our versioning control system. Instead of traditional branching, our workflow involved working on distinct tasks and coding within separate scripts. To facilitate parallel development without disrupting one another, we opted for a scene-based approach in Unity. This allowed team members to work on diverse tasks concurrently, enhancing efficiency and minimizing conflicts. In the event of identifying bugs, our protocol involved adding them to the GitHub issue tracker. To streamline the tracking process, we prefixed bug descriptions with the keyword "Bug." This categorization ensured that identified issues were promptly addressed, maintaining a structured and organized development environment.

Our team was made up of members with varying skill levels when it comes to game development. To accommodate this, tasks were distributed unevenly, with those possessing more knowledge taking on larger responsibilities. Members with more prior knowledge often worked independently, while those without prior experience engaged in pair-programming to mutually support and learn from each other. The collaborative effort extended to skill-sharing, with more experienced members aiding their less skilled counterparts, facilitating a smoother development process.

The semester presented multiple challenges, such as the demanding workload across multiple subjects. Despite a desire to dedicate more time to our project, competing academic commitments limited our availability. Additionally, the project faced initial hurdles due to what we perceived as a slow start and a lack of organizational structure, necessitating a more self-directed approach.

Overall, the project experience was okay, with the most notable challenges stemming from skill differences and time constraints. Despite these hurdles, our team navigated through the project successfully, overcoming most obstacles. The collaborative dynamics, though uneven due to varying skill levels, proved effective in ensuring the project's progression.
