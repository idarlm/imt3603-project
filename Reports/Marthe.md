## Video
A **video** showing off the **code** that is tightinly integrated with the game engine that is difficult to see from the text of the programming.
- Linking objects to puzzle files
- Puzzle integration
- Prefabs made from the other prefabs, easy to put inside the world

## Good code
A link to, and discussion of, code you consider **good**.
- Animation code
- Trigger group

## Bad code
A link to, and discussion of, code you consider **bad**.
- Keypad puzzle
  - Was originally created to to switch between different objects
  - Was later decided to use a cube that could rotate on interaction
  - Decided not to change the code because of time, and rather wright about it in the report

## Reflection
A personal **reflection** about the key concepts you learnt during the course.
- Started without any knowledge<br>
I started this course with no knowledge about game programming. I also had no previous experience with Unity or other game engines, so it took some time to learn how to use it.

- Some people in the group had experience with Unity<br>
In our group we had two people with no previous knowledge, including me, and two who had some expirience with Unity and game programming. Because of this, we had set some high expectations for our game, but understood that some of us had to do more work than others because of our mixed knowledge. In the time we had to work with the game, I used a lot of time in the beggining to try and understand what Unity was and how to use it.
Consepts I learned about Unity was for example its itegrated input system for movement and interactions. However, this was not one of my taskt in the project. I also learned making game objects, serializable fields that's visible in Unity, making prefabs and adding materials. 
After learning about Unity I had to start participating in the actual coding of our game, and I felt it was very hard to know where to begin. Me and the other group member with no previous knowledge was in charge of implementing the puzzles of our game. This included coming up with puzzles that we thought was doable for us.

- Learned more about the logic, connecting objects with scripts and triggers, c#, gameobjects, prefabs, scenes
- Too high ambitions
- Hard to follow and understand everything the other groupmembers did, because of limited knowledge and limited time to learn everything
- Had help starting puzzles
- Had to revise much of the code, because of new and better knowledge. Made new generic scripts. Did this myself
