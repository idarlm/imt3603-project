## Reflection
A personal **reflection** about the key concepts you learnt during the course.
- Started without any knowledge
- Some people in the group had experience with Unity
- Learned more about the logic, connecting objects with scripts and triggers, c#
- Too high ambitions
- Hard to follow and understand everything the other groupmembers did, because of limited knowledge and limited time to learn everything
